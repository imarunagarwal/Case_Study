Elizabeth is a beautifully restored vintage steam wagon who, like all trucks on the island, believes that roads are much better than rails. She tends to wear a scowl and will be quick to correct the engines who comment on her age by exclaiming \"I'm not old--I'm vintage.\" She has no patience for dawdlers. If you are here, you'd better be here to work."

      "product_description": "Dapol OO Gauge Stanier 57ft non corridor coach in BR Carmine Red Livery, unlined. Plastic model kit. Manufacturers Description: William Stanier (1876-1965) was headhunted from the GWR to become Chief Mechanical Engineer of London, Midland and Scottish (LMS) Railways in 1932. With the support of the Chairman, Sir Josiah Stamp, Stanier is credited with modernising the LMS fleet of generally small steam locomotives with a larger, modern and more powerful array of designs. Soon after his appointment, Stanier also focused on refurbishing and standardising the Coach stock of the LMS and developed the Period III LMS coaches which later became known as Stanier Coaches. These designs were extremely popular and successful and many were still in service in the mid 1960Â’s. There are many examples of Period III coaches operating on Heritage Railways throughout the UK today. The Dapol OO Model of the Stanier Coach is derived from refurbished Airfix/Mainline tooling originally purchased by Dapol in the 1980Â’s. There are some compromises on detail accuracy due to the condition and usability of the 40+ year old tooling. However, we feel the model captures the essence of the Period III coach design well and offers an extremely affordable way of building up a fleet of pre or post nationalised fleet of LMS coaches. Dapol have strived to ensure livery and colour details have been captured and are comparable to the originals, including the roof level gold lines. The Kit comes complete with decorated body, all that is required is painting of the roof and other components and assembly. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS ITEM IS NOT A TOY AND IS INTENDED FOR MODEL RAILWAY ENTHUSIASTS."

      "product_description": "Product Description The LNER Class A3 Pacific locomotive No. 4472 Flying Scotsman (originally No. 1472) was built in 1923 for the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) at Doncaster Works to a design of H.N. Gresley. It was employed on long-distance express trains on the LNER and its successors, British Railways Eastern and North-Eastern Regions, notably on the 10am London to Edinburgh Flying Scotsman service after which it was named. In its career 4472 Flying Scotsman has covered more than 2,000,000 miles (3,200,000 km).Young or old, keen modeller or just a beginner, the Hornby RailRoad range answers the needs of many and is a perfect complement to the variety of locomotives, rolling stock, track, buildings, and accessories that can be found in the current Hornby catalogue. Devoid of easily damaged detail parts the suitably livered RailRoad locomotives are fitted with efficient drive mechanisms and have pickups on all drive wheels ensuring smooth running. All the RailRoad models are fitted with the standard Hornby hook and bar type couplings and will therefore easily couple to those locomotives and rolling stock in both the standard Hornby and Thomas & Friends ranges. With this in mind it is easy to see that those models that make up the Hornby RailRoad range are a simple and cost effective way of adding to a train set providing a suitable and most appropriate stepping stone into the varied and fascinating World of model railways.The introductory range offers not only a selection of individual locomotives, rolling stock and accessories but an assortment of train and wagon packs ideally suited for either train set rolling stock enhancements or for those who wish to experiment and try their hands at developing their modelling techniques!This DCC Ready locomotive is compatible with analogue train layouts, but can easily be converted for use on a DCC (digital) layout.
